// We then shuffle that array to have a working array to sort.
// The idea is to keep the original sorted array in order to compare against it later.

    // An example about how this works:
    //     - Assume the max value is 1337 and powerOfTen starts as 1.
    //     - Therefore: 1337 / 1 = 1337.
    //     - This is greater than 0, so we run the while loop.
    //     - The next time around we compare 1337 / 10 > 0.
    //     - Using integer division 1337 / 10 = 133, which is greater than 0 so we continue the loop.
    //     - The next time: 1337 / 100 = 13 > 0.
    //     - The next time: 1337 / 1000 = 1 > 0.
    //     - However: 1337 / 10000 = 0, which is not greater than 0. Therefore we stop the loop.
    //     - This means that the loop ran four times, the max value's number of digits.

        array = array.compactMap { value in
            // Inside of the brackets we figure out in which "bucket" (index) to place the value.
            // An example about how this works:
            //     - Assume we we are looking at value 83.
            //     - We would expect to place this in the 3rd bucket the first time around.
            //     - We would expect to place this in the 8th bucket the second time around.
            //     - We would expect any subsequent times to place the value in the 0th bucket.
            //     - (note: we are using 0-indexed ordinal numbers;
            //        therefore the 0th bucket is really the first array,
            //        the 1st bucket is the second array,
            //        et cetera)
            //     - So the first time we start with 83 / 1 = 83 % 10 = 3.
            //     - The second time we calculate 83 / 10 = 8 % 10 = 8.
            //     - (note: remember that we are using integer division)
            //     - The third time we calculate 83 / 100 = 0 % 10 = 0.
            //     - Any subsequent time will continue to calculate 0.

        // We are also taking each value out of the individual buckets IN ORDER.
        // Meaning that the "front" of the array is "popped" first.
        // This is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) operation.
